 * of a method call to get the logger (i.e., keeps logging code concise).
 * 
 * <p>
 * The logger has package access but can be set from external source (outside this package)
 * through {@link #setLogger} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, because we do not want to grant public access to {@link #LOGGER},
 * this class must be present as a copy in every package you want to use it in.
